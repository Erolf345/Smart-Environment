Setup without any issues following the official description of raspberry pi:

https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera/2

## Materials
 - Raspberry
 - Raspberry Pi Camera V2.1
 
## Result

One of the three tested cameras doesn't seem to work.

## Testable Project

For a first sensor-actuator test, setup camera as well as PIR sensor and run code ``camera_sensor.py`` on pi. Now every time a motion is detected, the camera will take an image.
